# Networking configuration

```shell script
# Enable/disable networking:
/etc/sysconfig/network:
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=server1

/etc/init.d/network status  # status of network service
/etc/init.d/NetworkManager  # controls eth0 if NM_CONTROLLED="yes" in ifcfg-eth0

# Networkmanager info:
nmcli device show
nmcli connection show

```shell script
# Arp displays a table of IP addresses or hostnames with HW addresses.
# This can be helpful in identifying duplicate HW addresses.

cat /proc/net/arp  # print IP addresses and HW addresses

arp -n          # show IP addresses instead of hostnames
arp -s testbox 00:00:00:00:00:00  # set HWaddress of testbox
arp -d testbox  # delete HWaddress of testbox from table
```

```shell script
ifconfig -a              # show all network interfaces active and inactive
ip addr                  # show ip addresses assigned to all network interfaces

ifconfig eth0 <up down>  # enable/disable eth0

#### NSS

```shell script
# Name Service Switch, sources for common configuration databases.
/etc/nsswitch.conf:
hosts: files dns  # this line means /etc/hosts is searched first, dns second

service nscd status             # status of Name Service Cache Daemon

/etc/hosts:

/etc/resolv.conf:
nameserver		8.8.8.8
```

#### TCP Wrappers

```shell script
# Check if a service uses TCP Wrappers:
for FILE in /sbin/*; do strings $FILE | grep -q hosts_access && echo $FILE; done
for FILE in /usr/sbin/*; do strings $FILE | grep -q hosts_access && echo $FILE; done

# Confirm that sshd is linked to the TCP Wrapper library:
ldd /usr/sbin/sshd | grep libwrap

# TCP Wrapper process:
# 1) /etc/hosts.allow is searched, if a match is found access is granted, no additional search.
# 2) /etc/hosts.deny is searched, if a match is found, access is denied, no additional search.
# 3) If a match isnâ€™t found in either file, access is automatically granted.

/etc/hosts.allow:
vsftpd, sshd : 192.168.1.111     # allow services vsftp and ssh to 192.168.1.111

/etc/hosts.deny:
ALL : 192.168.                   # deny all services to the 192.168 subnet
sshd : ALL EXCEPT 192.168.110.1  # deny ssh to all except 192.168.110.1

# Limit ssh access to only mike from 192.168.0.11:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:
PermitRootLogin no
AllowUsers mike@192.168.0.11
/etc/init.d/sshd reload

# Disable X11 forwarding over ssh:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:
#X11Forwarding yes
