# Arp displays a table of IP addresses or hostnames with HW addresses.
# This can be helpful in identifying duplicate HW addresses.
cat /proc/net/arp  # print IP addresses and HW addresses
arp -n  # display IP addresses instead of hostnames
arp -s testbox 00:00:00:00:00:00  # sets HWaddress of testbox respectively
arp -d testbox  # deletes HWaddress of testbox from table

netstat -r  # display routing table with gateway and interface
netstat -t  # list only established tcp connections
netstat -atpn  # list established and listening tcp connections with PID, numeric

ss  # socket statistics showing send and receive queues, useful for determining latency
