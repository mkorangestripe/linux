# Networking diagnostics

### Layer 2 (link layer)

```shell script
ethtool eth0 | egrep 'Speed|Link'    # show speed and link status of network adaptor

cat /proc/net/arp                    # show IP and HW addresses

arp -n                               # show IP and HW addresses, add -a on macOS
ip neigh                             # show IP and HW addresses

arp -s testbox 00:00:00:00:00:00     # set HW address of testbox
arp -d testbox                       # delete HW address of testbox from table

arp-scan --interface=en0 --localnet  # scan subnet for connected hosts even without IP addresses

tcpdump arp                          # listen for arp traffic

tcpdump -i en0 -n broadcast          # listen for broadcast messages on interface en0
```

##### Wireless networking info

```shell script
# Channels 1, 6, and 11 do not overlap.
# Try to use a channel that overlaps with the least number of other channels that are in use.
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

iwconfig wlan0 | grep Link                     # check link quality
iwlist wlan0 scan | egrep '(Channel|Quality)'  # scan for channel numbers and link quality

wpa_cli  # WPA command line client
```

### Layer 3 (network Layer)

##### nmap

```shell
nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24  # ping scan the subnet
```

##### traceroute, tracepath

```shell
# Trace the route to the given host, wait 2 second for a reply, send 1 probe packet (query)
# per hop, limit max number of hops to 15, use interface eth0:
traceroute -w 2 -q 1 -m 15 -i eth0 accounts.l.google.com

# Traces path to a network host discovering MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) along this path:
tracepath google.com
```

##### tcpdump

```shell
# Listen for arp (layer 2) and icmp traffic:
tcpdump "arp or icmp"
```

```shell
# Capture 100 packets from the host and write to file.
tcpdump host 192.168.1.110 -w capture.cap -c 100

# Read the capture file:
tcpdump -r capture.cap | less
```

```shell script
# Find Cisco Discovery Protocol (layer 2) information.
# Useful for finding make/model and other information of network hardware.

# Verbose output, capture one packet and exit, capture only packets
# that have a 2 byte value of hex 2000 starting at byte 20.
tcpdump -v -c 1 'ether[20:2] == 0x2000'

# Same as above, but doesn't convert hostname, protocol, port numbers to names.
# More verbose, just traffic on network adapter eth0, and capture 1500 bytes of the packet (typical MTU size).
tcpdump -nn -vvv -i eth0 -s 1500 -c 1 'ether[20:2] == 0x2000'
```

### Layer 4 (transport)

##### netstat, traceroute

```shell script
netstat -t     # list only established tcp connections
netstat -atpn  # list established and listening tcp connections with PID, numeric

# Trace route to host, use tcp syn for probes, transport layer traceroute
traceroute -T accounts.l.google.com
```

##### tcpdump

```shell script
# Listen to traffic for host on port 80.  Donâ€™t resolve hostname or port
tcpdump -nni eth0 host 10.48.116.28 and port 80

# Listen for tcp-syn, and all ack packets
tcpdump "tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-ack) != 0"
```

##### ss

```shell script
ss  # socket statistics showing send and receive queues, useful for determining latency
```

##### Test TCP connections

```shell script
nmap -sS -p 53 8.8.8.8        # scan SYN port 53, after the syn-ack is received, a rst packet is sent
nmap -sA -p 53 8.8.8.8        # scan ACK port 53, useful for finding filtered ports

nmap centoskvm1               # scan for any open ports on centoskvm1
nc -zv google.com 80          # scan port 80
nc -z -w 1 centoskvm1 20-640  # scan ports 20-640
nc -v -i 1 server1 2049       # scan port 2049 (ncat version)
nc -zu centoskvm1 514         # scan udp port 514

nc centoskvm1 22              # connect to port 22 if open on centoskvm1
telnet centoskvm1 22          # connect to port 22 if open on centoskvm1

curl centoskvm1:22            # connect to port 22 and print message from daemon
curl -v centoskvm1:22         # same as above but verbose
```

```shell script
# Check a broader range and filter for successful connections:
for OCTET3 in `seq 1 255`; do
    for OCTET4 in `seq 1 255`; do
        echo $OCTET3 $OCTET4
        nc -zv -w 1 192.168.$OCTET3.$OCTET4 80
    done
done 2>&1 | tee port80.txt | grep succeeded

# In a second terminal, check the progress:
tail -f port80.txt
```

##### Netcat

```shell script
# Transfer a file with netcat
nc -l 5900 > ncfile                        # listen on port 5900
nc -w 1 tester1 5900 < ncfile              # transfer ncfile to tester1 on port 5900
```

```shell
# Tail a remote log with netcat
nc -l 5900                                 # listen on port 5900
tail -f /var/tmp/nclog | nc blackbox 5900  # tail nclog and send to blackbox on 5900
```

### DNS

##### dig, host, nslookup

```shell script
dig @192.168.0.1 google.com  # lookup google.com through 192.168.0.1

dig +trace amazon.com        # find where domain is registered
dig +short soa amazon.com

dig amazon.com ns            # find name servers for domain

dig -x 8.8.8.8               # reverse dns lookup for 8.8.8.8
host 8.8.8.8                 # reverse dns lookup for 8.8.8.8
nslookup 8.8.8.8             # reverse dns lookup for 8.8.8.8
```
