Bootloader, Runlevels, Consoles
___________________________________________________

RHEL 6, boot into specific runlevel from the kernel line in the grub menu, delete rhgb quiet (if desired), and append one of the following.

init=/bin/sh
/ is mounted (ro) although mount reports (rw)
only /, /proc, and /sys are mounted

emergency
/ is mounted (ro) although mount reports (rw)
only /, /proc, and /sys are mounted
init is running

single, s, S
/ is mounted (rw)
local filesystems mounted
init is running
runs everything but scripts in /etc/rc1.d ???

/etc/inittab:
0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
1 - Single user mode
2 - Multiuser, without NFS (The same as 3, if you do not have networking)
3 - Full multiuser mode
4 - unused
5 - X11
6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)

Runlevel 4 is listed as unused, but starts based on system initialization.

runlevel (prints previous current)
who -r  (prints current runlevel)

boot process:
BIOS loads grub
grub loads the linux kernel
Linux kernel calls the init process
init process runs /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit

/etc/init/rcS.conf  (exec /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit)
/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit  (sets the environment path, starts swap, checks the file systems, etc)
/etc/init/rc.conf  (exec /etc/rc.d/rc $RUNLEVEL)
/etc/rc.d/rc  (executes scripts in runlevel, /etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d/)

rc stands for runcom, run command.

/etc/init/prefdm.conf  (persistently start/stop the GUI on a specific runlevel)
startx  (starts the GUI)

chkconfig --list postfix
chkconfig postfix on
chkconfig --level 4 postfix off  (moves /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S80postfix to K30postfix)
Links beginning with "K" are to be stopped whenever leaving the runlevel they are in.
Links beginning with "S" are to be started, whenever the system is entering the runlevel they are about to go in to.
ntsysv --level 345  (config services for runlevels 3,4,and 5)

service --status-all  (shows status of all services)
svcs -a (show status of all services on Solaris)
svcs -v ssh (show verbose of ssh, -l for all available info)
svcs -x http  (displays explanations for service states on Solaris)
service httpd start  (start httpd)
svcadm enable -t http (enable and start http on Solaris)
service sshd restart  (restart sshd)
svcadm restart ssh  (restart ssh on Solaris)
service sshd reload  (reload sshd config)
svcadm refresh ssh  (reload ssh config on Solaris)
service httpd stop  (stop httpd)
svcadm disable -t http  (disable and stop http on Solaris)
svcadm clear http  (clear http from maintenance state on Solaris)
/var/svc/log/  (service logs on Solaris)
/etc/systemd/ (SystemD info)

shutdown -r 10 “message”  (reboot in 10 minutes with message)
shutdown -h now  (halt or poweroff after bringing down system)
shutdown -y -i5 -g0 (yes, init 5, grace period 0s - halt or poweroff on Solaris)
shutdown -H now  (halts the system after being brought down)
shutdown -P now  (powers off the system after being brought down)
shutdown -c  (cancel a running shutdown)
shutdown -k now (send warning msg, disable logins, do not shutdown)

/sbin/shutdown
/sbin/telinit
/sbin/init

/usr/bin/reboot -> consolehelper
/usr/bin/halt -> consolehelper
/usr/bin/poweroff -> consolehelper

grub-md5-crypt  (create an md5 password)
password --md5 <password-hash>  (place after ‘timeout’ or a title line in  grub.conf)

From the grub prompt at system start:
grub> root  (identify partition with boot directory)
grub> find /grub/grub.conf  (identify partition with boot directory)
grub> find (hd0,0)/grub/grub.conf  (identify Linux partitions)
grub> cat (hd0,0)/grub/grub.conf  (print grub.conf)
grub> cat (hd0,1)/etc/fstab  (print fstab, does not work with logical volumes)

Boot system from grub prompt:
Use tab to autocomplete and list file names.
grub> root (hd0,0)  -- (necessary if MBR was modified)
grub> kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.32-71.el6.x86_64 ro root=/dev/dm-0
grub> initrd /initramfs-2.6.32-71.el6.x86_64.img
grub> boot

Reinstalling the Boot Loader:
Choose Rescue installed system from the menu or try the following:
Type linux rescue at the installation boot prompt to enter the rescue environment.
chroot /mnt/sysimage  (mount the root partition)
/sbin/grub-install /dev/sda  (reinstall the GRUB boot loader)
Review /boot/grub/grub.conf

XCFS:
showdomainstatus -a (show status of all domains)
showlogs power (display log of resets, poweron/off)
showstatus (Lists degraded components)
fmdump -v (view fault management logs, verbose)
reset -d 0 (Domain 0 reset)
reset -d 0 por (Domain 0 system reset)
reset -d 0 xir (Domain 0 CPU reset)
poweroff -d 0 (poweroff domain 0)
poweron -d 0 (poweron domain 0)
console -yd 0 (connect to domain 0 console)
printenv (from the OK prompt, check whether auto-boot is enabled)
boot (from the OK prompt on the console, boot the OS)
#. (pound+period, return to XSCF shell)

Reboot the ilo/ilom console, examples:
show
/SP is the service processor, /SYS is the server itself.
cd /SP and run the 'reset' command.

show
/system1 is the system, /map1 is the ilo
cd /map1 and run 'reset' command.
